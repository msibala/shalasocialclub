        Shala Social Club is a gathering for anyone searching for a sense of home—
        especially those navigating life between cultures. Founded by Filipino immigrants
        Trish &amp; Mia, Shala is rooted in the warmth of Filipino hospitality and built
        on the belief that culture is best shared through food, art, storytelling,
        and community.

            <h3 class="subheading">Loneliness Epidemic</h3>
            <p class="body-text">
              LA and NYC are hotspots for loneliness, particularly among young
              professionals and transplants.

            <h3 class="subheading">Seeking Community IRL</h3>
            <p class="body-text">
              We’ve seen the rise of third spaces, run clubs, Timeleft, lectures on tap,
              and The Table—even niche lookalike contests—all signaling that people
              want intentional, offline community again.

            <h3 class="subheading">Cultural Gap</h3>
            <p class="body-text">
              But we’re not seeing many social clubs that highlight culture and heritage.
              Shala exists to fill that gap.
